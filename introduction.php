<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Thank you for agreeing to take part in this year’s Felix Sex Survey. After the success of last year’s, we’re looking forward to seeing if and how any characteristics have changed. As with last year, the results are completely confidential. For complete information on the privacy and data protection, click the button below. In brief, your username is only required to prevent trolling and restrict the questionnaire to Imperial students. At no point will it be possible for your answer to be matched to you.</p>

        <h3>Further Privacy Information</h3>

    <div class="modal-body">
        <p>Your college log-in is encoded and stored in a database on a secure union server completely separate to your questionnaire answers. Your user name is stored simply so the computer knows that you have completed the survey. The computer also checks the answer you give for "department" in the questionaire against the department registered to your username, and the result of this check will be stored on the qustionaire results as a true/false value. At no point will this list of usernames be seen by anyone from Felix, the Union or the College (and as it’s encoded, even if they did see it, it wouldn’t mean much). Once the survey is finished (10th February) the user name database will be deleted, and the questionnaire answers will then be made available to a very small number of Felix writers who will be analysing them. The data will only be stored on Felix’s computers and will be transferred by secure College file-exchange. At no point will personal computers or USB sticks be used.</p>
        <p>To reiterate: at no point will it be possible for your questionnaire answers to be matched to you.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, once the article has been printed (17th February) all remaining data will be deleted. </p>
