<h3>Background information</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to answer any question, just leave it at the default setting. At the end of the survey you will be asked confirm the questions you’ve left blank (to make sure they’re blank intentionally and not just overlooked).</p>
<p>This questionnaire should take no more that 10 minutes. The number of questions varies depending on previous answers but the maximum number is 30.</p>
<p>While this is a light-hearted exercise, honesty is encouraged. We would like reiterate again that your results are completely anonymous. Any concerns may be addressed to <a href="mailto: felix@imperial.ac.uk">felix@imperial.ac.uk</a>.</p>
